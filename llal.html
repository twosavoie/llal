            <h3>Why Hire Us?</h3>
            <p>Remember how easy vacationing was as a kid? Showing up to camp and just having fun! We recreate that for you. Tell us what you like to do and our local concierge will make all the arrangements. And because we're local, we know all about the limited-time exhibits, the hole-in-the-wall bbq joint, the best place to park to rush in to get your latte without getting a ticket. Leave it up to us!</p>
